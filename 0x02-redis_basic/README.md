### Tasks

#### Task 0: 📝 Writing strings to Redis
Ready to unveil the magic of Redis? In this task, you'll create a `Cache` class that stores data in Redis using randomly generated keys. Your data will be safe and sound, ready to be accessed at lightning speed!

#### Task 1: 📖 Reading from Redis and recovering original type
Redis has more tricks up its sleeve! Enhance the `Cache` class by implementing a method that reads data from Redis and recovers its original type. Redis will reveal the true nature of your stored values!

#### Task 2: 🔢 Incrementing values
Counting made easy! Discover the power of decorators in this task. Implement a function counter that keeps track of method calls in the `Cache` class. Redis will become your trusty assistant, tallying up the numbers!

#### Task 3: 📚 Storing lists
Redis handles more than just individual values! Let's explore lists together. Create a decorator that saves the history of inputs and outputs for a specific function. Redis will transform into your personal librarian, meticulously organizing your lists!

#### Task 4: 🔄 Retrieving lists
Redis, the time traveler! Develop a function that retrieves the history of function calls and presents it in an insightful format. Redis will rewind the clock, allowing you to replay the past and gain valuable insights!

Are you ready to unlock the full potential of Redis? Let's dive into each task and unleash the power of in-memory storage together! 🎉💪
